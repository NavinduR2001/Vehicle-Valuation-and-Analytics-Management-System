## Introduction
This project is developed under the course module **“IS Project for Community”** offered by the  
**Faculty of Computing, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka**, under the **Computing and Information Systems** degree program.

The automobile industry increasingly depends on digital technologies to enhance efficiency and service quality.  
Vehicle valuation companies such as **Rawan Auto Care** play a crucial role in providing accurate valuation services for insurance companies. However, many of these processes are still handled manually, leading to inefficiencies such as poor performance tracking, financial inconsistencies, and limited data visibility.

To address these challenges, our project introduces a **web-based Vehicle Valuation and Analytics Management System** that streamlines daily operations, automates financial management, generates valuation reports, and delivers insightful analytics for informed decision-making.  
The system is secure, scalable, and user-friendly, featuring role-based dashboards for administrators, managers, and employees.
